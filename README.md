#### Task Management App

Welcome to the Task Management App! This application allows users to manage their tasks with a simple login system. Whether you're organizing your personal to-do list or managing a project, this app has got you covered.

#### Features:

- User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to manage their tasks securely.
- Task Management: Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- Persistent Storage: All tasks and user sessions are stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring they persist across page reloads.
- User-specific Task Lists: Each user has their own separate task list, so tasks are not shared between accounts.
- Responsive Design: The app is designed to work well on different screen sizes.
